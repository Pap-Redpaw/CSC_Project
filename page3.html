                The conditions around a reading and/or writing act are referred to as rhetorical context. 
                The author, the author's intent, the topic, the audience, and the occasion, or external incentive, for writing are all elements of rhetorical context.
                Rhetorical context relates to web design in a few ways. One of them being that websites should be designed for its target audience and topic. To begin making a website, 
                you must determine who your target audience is, what your website's objective is, and how you want to present your material.
